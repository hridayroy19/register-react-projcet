                     Generally speaking, the project management process includes the following stages: planning, initiation, execution, monitoring, and closing.

                     Project management can be broken down into five steps: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closing. These obviously are broad steps, and a project manager's job is to apply them specifically to the project at hand in a way that is most efficient. How those steps are executed can vary depending on the type of project management being used.
                     
                    This is similar to traditional project management but includes the caveat that each task needs to be completed before the next one starts. Steps are linear and progress flows in one directionâ€”like a waterfall. Because of this, attention to task sequences and timelines is very important in this type of project management. Often, the size of the team working on the project will grow as smaller tasks are completed and larger tasks begin.
